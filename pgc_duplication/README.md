The code included here is duplicated from the Polar Geospatial Center's `imagery_utils` and is included for documentation purposes only.
A newer version of `imagery_utils` has been packaged with this repo as a git submodule.
That version should be used for all future processing.

Likewise, do not modify the code here.

This directory will likely be deleted in the future.
