This is a checklist for adding .tif images (like the Rrs images) to GEE.

1. go to code.earthengine.com
2. switch to assets tab
3. new -> GeoTIFF
4. select file & click ok
5. wait for upload (under tasks tab) to finish (will take ~1hr)
6. add the new image to relevant collection (eg `projects/imars-dwc-sdm/assets/wv_m1bs_atm_rookery`)
    a. select the imageCollection asset
    b. under `images` tab select `ADD IMAGE`
    c. paste in the asset name of the image (eg: ` projects/imars-dwc-sdm/assets/wv_m1bs_atm_rookery/20100301T162229_01_P009_WV02_Rrs_Rookery `)
    d. click okay (NOTE: sometimes the ok button is weird - fiddle around in the asset name box until it works)
